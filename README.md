# Basic DNN Comparison on MNIST data set

Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are
two powerful machine learning algorithms that have been widely used in the
field of computer vision. Top performances on various datasets, including the
MNIST dataset, have been achieved with these algorithms.
The MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test
images, represents grayscale images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.
The goal is to develop models capable of accurately classifying these images in
their respective categories. Extensive research has been conducted on this data-
set, making it a fundamental resource for evaluating and comparing different
algorithms.
In this work, the performances of DNN and CNN on the MNIST dataset
were compared. DNNs are artificial neural networks that can learn hierarchical
representations of input data through multiple layers of neurons. On the other
hand, CNNs are specifically designed for image processing tasks, incorporating
features such as convolution and pooling layers, which allow them to efficiently
capture spatial dependencies in images.
The objective of this work is to analyze and compare the capabilities of
these two neural network architectures in terms of accuracy, and computational
efficiency. By examining their performance on the MNIST dataset, insights into
the strengths and weaknesses of DNN and CNN can be gained, making it easier
to understand which architecture is more suitable for image classification tasks
